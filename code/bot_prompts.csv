system,"You are particpating in an online survey and/or experiment. Each prompt contains a summary of the survey/experiment including your answers so far, scarped text data from a webpage continuing the survey/experiment, and detailed tasks for you on how to analysze this text data. Answers must be given as JSON code ONLY. No text outside of the JSON answer is allowed at any time. In each prompt, I will provide you with detailed information on the repsective format."
start,"Hi there! In this conversation. I want you to participate in an online experiment, potentially involving other human or artificial participants. I will provide you with a series of web page body text excerpts that will sequentially guide you through the experiment. The texts will contain instructions on how the experiment will be conducted. These instructions will be followed by additional pages that might contain additional instructions, comprehension checks, repeated information from prior pages and, most importantly, present you with questions and/or tasks which I want you to answer. All answers must be given as JSON code ONLY and I will provide you with detailed information on the repsective format. As all texts are scraped from the body parts of web pages, they might contain also additional information or text bits that do not really belong to the experiment. Do you understand your task? Please answer by setting the value of 'understood' to 'yes' or 'no', meaning that {'understood': 'yes'} indincates that you understand. Please provide your answer ONLY as JSON. If you are confused, respond with {'error': 'I am confused'}."
analyze_page_no_q_full_hist,"Perfect. You have now proceeded to the next page. This is the body text of the web page:\n\n{body}\n\nI need you to summarize the content of the page and indicate what you learn from it about the survey/experiment that you are participating in. Provide the summary as the variable 'summary' in a JSON string." 
analyze_page_q_full_hist,"Perfect. You have now proceeded to the next page. This is the body text of the web page:\n\n{body}\n\nI need you to summarize the content of the page and indicate what you learn from it about the survey/experiment that you are participating in. Provide the summary as the variable 'summary'. Second, this page contains {nr_q} questions that I want you to answer in the variable 'questions'. So, your JSON answer will contain the variables 'summary', and 'questions'. I need you to answer all questions. The following JSON string contains the questions: '{questions_json}'. Each question id characerized by an ID ('question_id') and a label ('question_label'). You might find more context about the questions in the body text quoted above. In partciular, you will find any answer options in the text above. Please strictly adhere to the answer options given above. If the question requires a numerical answer, please only provide a number.  This means that for each identified question, you must provide three variables: 'id' gives the question ID, 'summary' a brief summary how you understand the question, 'answer' contains your response, and 'reason' contains your reasoning for the response. The above implies that each question must be answered with a list of these three variables and, 'questions' becomes a list of lists if there are more than one question. Taken together, a correct answer to a text with two questions would have the form {{'summary': 'Your summary', 'questions': [['id': 'ID of first question', 'answer': 'Your answer', 'reason': 'Your reasoning'], ['id': 'ID of second question', 'answer': 'Your answer', 'reason': 'Your reasoning']]}} Please provide your answer ONLY as JSON.
