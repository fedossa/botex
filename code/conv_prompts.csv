start,"Hi there! In this conversation. I want you to participate in an online experiment, potentially involving other human or artificial participants. I will provide you with a series of web page body text excerpts that will sequentially guide you through the experiment. The texts will contain instructions on how the experiment will be conducted. These instructions will be followed by additional pages that might contain additional instructions, comprehension checks, repeated information from prior pages and, most importantly, present you with questions and/or tasks which I want you to answer. All answers must be given as JSON code ONLY and I will provide you with detailed information on the repsective format. As all texts are scraped from the body parts of web pages, they might contain also additional information or text bits that do not really belong to the experiment. Do you understand your task? Please answer by setting the value of 'understood' to 'yes' or 'no', meaning that {'understood': 'yes'} indincates that you understand. Please provide your answer ONLY as JSON. If you are confused, respond with {'error': 'I am confused'}."
summarize_first_page,"Perfect. Here comes the body text of the first page. This is its body text:\n\n{body}\n\nPlease summarize the content of the page and indicate what you learn from it about the experiment that you are participating in. Provide the summary as JSON as follows: {{'summary': 'your summary'}}. Please provide your answer ONLY as JSON. If you are confused, respond with {{'error': 'I am confused'}}."
summarize_page,"Perfect. You have now proceeded to the next page. This is the body text of the web page:\n\n{body}\n\nPlease summarize the content of the page and indicate what you learn from it about the experiment that you are participating in. Provide the summary as JSON as follows: {{'summary': 'your summary'}}. Please provide your answer ONLY as JSON. If you are confused, respond with {{'error': 'I am confused'}}."
analyze_page,"Thank you! Does the body of the text contain any task that you need to complete in order to proceed to the next page? The nature of the page can fall into one of four categories: (a), an invitation to wait until the other participant has made his or her decision, (b), a 'next' button that you would have to click to continue, (c), one or several questions that you would have to answer, potentially followed by a 'next' button to click to continue, or (d) a thank you page that concludes the experiment without any additional questions or button to click. Can you please identify to which group the page belongs? This will be the first variable 'category' of your JSON response, taking the value 'wait' for category (a), 'next' for group (b), 'question' for category (c) or 'end' for category (d). Only for category (c), in addition, you need to identify all questions that the text wants you to answer. Please name this list variable as 'question' and each separate question as an item to the list. So, a correct answer to a text belong to category (c) would have the form {'category': 'question', 'questions': ['Text of first question', 'Text of second question']} (it is possible that only one question exists) while for example a correct answer for a text of category (b) would simply be {'category': 'next'}. Please provide your answer ONLY as JSON. If you are confused, respond with {'error': 'I am confused'}." 
answer_question,"Wonderful! You have identified questions that you are tasked to answer. Please answer question {question_nr}: '{question_text}'. Please do this by first briefly summarizing the question again in the variable 'summary'. Then, provide your answer as the variable 'answer'. Please provide your answer exactly how you would fill out the according web form. Often (but not always), these forms require numerical values. So do not provide any additional text or explanation in the 'answer' variable. Instead, provide an additional variable 'reason'. There, you can briefly explain your decision-making. When providing your answer, please keep the instructions of the experiment and your overall objective in mind. A valid JSON structure for your response would be {{'summary': 'your summary', 'answer': 'your answer', 'reason': 'your reason'}}. Please provide your answer ONLY as JSON. If you are confused, respond with {{error: 'I am confused'}}."
end,"Perfect. This concludes the experimental run and our conversation. Do you have any final remarks about the experiment or its implementation in this conversation that you want to share? Please provide your answer as JSON, using the variable '. If you have no final remarks, respond with {remarks: 'none'}. If you are confused, respond with {error: 'I am confused'}."
json_error,"Unfortunately, your response was not in the correct JSON format. Please try again. If you are confused, respond with {error: 'I am confused'}."
