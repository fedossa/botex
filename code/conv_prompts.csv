start,"Hi there! In this conversation. I want you to participate in an online experiment, potentially involving other human or artificial participants. I will provide you with a series of web page body text excerpts that will sequentially guide you through the experiment. The texts will contain instructions on how the experiment will be conducted. These instructions will be followed by additional pages that might contain additional instructions, comprehension checks, repeated information from prior pages and, most importantly, present you with questions and/or tasks which I want you to answer. All answers must be given as JSON code ONLY and I will provide you with detailed information on the repsective format. As all texts are scraped from the body parts of web pages, they might contain also additional information or text bits that do not really belong to the experiment. Do you understand your task? Please answer by setting the value of 'understood' to 'yes' or 'no', meaning that {'understood': 'yes'} indincates that you understand. Please provide your answer ONLY as JSON. If you are confused, respond with {'error': 'I am confused'}."
analyze_page,"Perfect. You have now proceeded to the next page. This is the body text of the web page:\n\n{body}\n\nI need you to do three things. First, please summarize the content of the page and indicate what you learn from it about the experiment that you are participating in. Provide the summary as the variable 'summary'. Second, I want you to categorize the nature of the page, and to provide this category in the variable 'category'. More on this below. Third, if you identify any questions that require aswers on this form, I need you to provide your answer in the variable 'questions'. Again more on this below. So, your JSON answer will contain the variables 'summary', 'category', and, potentially if you identify questions, 'questions'. Now about the category of the page: The nature of the page can fall into one of four categories: (a), an invitation to wait until the other participant has made his or her decision, (b), some information and a 'next' button that you would have to click to continue, (c), one or several questions that you would have to answer, potentially followed by a 'next' button to click to continue, or (d) a thank you page that concludes the experiment without any additional questions or buttons to click. Can you please identify to which group the page belongs? This will be the second variable 'category' of your JSON response, taking the value 'wait' for category (a), 'next' for group (b), 'question' for category (c) or 'end' for category (d). Only for category (c), in addition, you need to identify all questions that the text wants you to answer and answer them. This means that for each identified question, you must provide three variables: 'text' would summarize the question, 'answer' would provide your response, and 'reason' would contain your reasoning for the response. Please provide your answer exactly how you would fill out the according web form. Often (but not always), these forms require numerical values. So do not provide any additional text or explanation in the 'answer' variable. The above implies that each question must be answered with a list of these three variables and, 'questions' becomes a list of lists with only one member for the situation that there is only one question present. Taken together, a correct answer to a text belong to category (c) with two questions would have the form {{'summary': 'Your summary', 'category': 'question', 'questions': [['text': 'Text of first question', 'answer': 'Your answer', 'reason': 'Your reasoning'], ['text': 'Text of second question', 'answer': 'Your answer', 'reason': 'Your reasoning']]}} (it is possible that only one question exists) while for example a correct answer for a text of category (b) would simply be {{'summary': 'Your summary', 'category': 'next'}}. Please provide your answer ONLY as JSON. If you are confused, respond with {{'error': 'I am confused'}}." 
end,"Perfect. This concludes the experimental run and our conversation. Do you have any final remarks about the experiment and how you played it, or about its implementation in this conversation that you want to share? Please provide your answer as JSON, using the variable 'remarks'. If you have no final remarks, respond with {remarks: 'none'}. If you are confused, respond with {error: 'I am confused'}."
json_error,"Unfortunately, your response was not in the correct JSON format. Please try again. If you are confused, respond with {error: 'I am confused'}."
