system,"You are participating in an online survey and/or experiment. Each prompt contains a summary of the survey/experiment including your answers so far, scraped text data from a webpage continuing the survey/experiment, and detailed tasks for you on how to analyze this text data. The materials might contain information on how participants are being compensated or paid for their participation. If this is the case, please act as if this compensation also applies to you and make sure to include this information in the summary. Answers must be given as JSON code ONLY. No text outside of the JSON answer is allowed at any time. In each prompt, I will provide you with detailed information on the respective format."
start,"Hi there! In this conversation, I want you to participate in an online survey and/or experiment, potentially involving other human or artificial participants. I will provide you with a series of web page body text excerpts that will sequentially guide you through the experiment/survey. These texts will contain instructions on how the experiment/survey will be conducted.\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n- Carefully read each page, including any additional instructions, comprehension checks, repeated information from prior pages, and especially any questions or tasks presented to you.\n\n- All answers must be given **ONLY** as JSON code. I will provide you with detailed information on the specific format required for each response.\n\n- Be aware that since all texts are scraped from the body parts of web pages, they might contain additional information or text bits that do not belong to the experiment.\n\n**Confirmation of Understanding:**\n\n- Do you understand your task?\n\n- Please answer **ONLY** as a JSON object with the following structure:\n\n{\n  ""task"": ""Your summary of the task here as a string"",\n  ""understood"": true\n}\n\n- The ""task"" value should be a concise summary of your task.\n\n- The ""understood"" key is **mandatory** and should be set to `true` if you understand the instructions, or `false` if you do not.\n\n**Important:**\n\n- Do **NOT** include any information outside of the JSON object.\n\n- Use proper **JSON formatting** to structure your response."
analyze_page_no_q_full_hist,"Perfect. You have now proceeded to the next page. This is the body text of the web page:\n\n{body}\n\nI need you to summarize the content of the page and indicate what you learn from it about the survey/experiment that you are participating in. Provide the summary as a string variable 'summary' in a JSON string.Please note that, while you can use JSON to structure the summary content, the variable itself must be provided as a string." 
analyze_page_q_full_hist,"Perfect. You have now proceeded to the next page. This is the body text of the web page:\n\n{body}\n\nI need you to do two things. First, this page contains {nr_q} question(s) and I need you to answer all questions in the variable 'answers'. Second, I need you to summarize the content of the page including all questions and your answer. Provide the summary as the variable 'summary'. More on this below. If you are confused, please indicate this by setting the 'confused' key  to true. So, your JSON answer will contain the variables 'answers', 'summary' and 'confused'. I need you to answer all questions. The following JSON string contains the questions: '{questions_json}'. Each question is characterized by an ID ('question_id'), question type ('question_type'),  and a label ('question_label'). Additionally, if the question type requires it, you will also be provided with answer choices. If there are answer choices provided, first answer with the full answer choice text and do not just answer with a number indicating the answer choice. Second please strictly adhere to the given answer choices, please do not select something outside of the given answer choices. If there are no answer choices provided, it means you can answer the question freely. If the question type is 'number', please only provide an integer number. This means that for each identified question, you must provide two variables: 'reason' contains your reasoning or thought that leads you to a response or answer and 'answer' which contains your response. The above implies that each question must be answered as a json object, with the question id as a key and an answer object containing reason and answer  as a value. Taken together, a correct answer to a text with two questions would have the form {{""answers"": {{""ID of first question"": {{""reason"": ""Your reasoning for how you want to answer the first question"", ""answer"":""Your final answer to the first question""}}, ""ID of the second question"": {{""reason"": ""Your reasoning for how you want to answer the second question"", ""answer"": ""Your final answer to the second question""}}}},""summary"": ""Your summary"", ""confused"": ""set to `true` if you are confused by any part of the instructions, otherwise set it to `false`""}}.Please provide your answer ONLY as JSON.
