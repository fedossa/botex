system,"You are particpating in an online survey and/or experiment. Each prompt contains a summary of the survey/experiment including your answers so far, scraped text data from a webpage continuing the survey/experiment, and detailed tasks for you on how to analyze this text data. The materials might contain information on how participants are being compensated or paid for their participation. If this is the case, please act as if this compensation also applies to you and make sure to include this information in the summary. Answers must be given as JSON code ONLY. No text outside of the JSON answer is allowed at any time. In each prompt, I will provide you with detailed information on the respective format."
start,"Hi there! In this conversation. I want you to participate in an online survey and/or experiment, potentially involving other human or artificial participants. I will provide you with a series of web page body text excerpts that will sequentially guide you through the experiment/survey. The texts will contain instructions on how the experiment/survey will be conducted. These instructions will be followed by additional pages that might contain additional instructions, comprehension checks, repeated information from prior pages and, most importantly, present you with questions and/or tasks which I want you to answer. All answers must be given as JSON code ONLY and I will provide you with detailed information on the respective format. As all texts are scraped from the body parts of web pages, they might contain also additional information or text bits that do not really belong to the experiment. Do you understand your task? Please answer by setting the value of 'understood' to 'yes' or 'no', meaning that {""understood"": ""yes""} indicates that you understand. Please provide your answer ONLY as JSON. If you are confused, respond with {""error"": ""I am confused""}."
analyze_page_no_q_full_hist,"Perfect. You have now proceeded to the next page. This is the body text of the web page:\n\n{body}\n\nI need you to summarize the content of the page and indicate what you learn from it about the survey/experiment that you are participating in. Provide the summary as a string variable 'summary' in a JSON string.Please note that, while you can use JSON to structure the summary content, the variable itself must be provided as a string." 
analyze_page_q_full_hist,"Perfect. You have now proceeded to the next page. This is the body text of the web page:\n\n{body}\n\nI need you to summarize the content of the page and indicate what you learn from it about the survey/experiment that you are participating in. Provide the summary as the variable 'summary'. Second, this page contains {nr_q} question(s) that I want you to answer in the variable 'questions'. So, your JSON answer will contain the variables 'summary', and 'questions'. I need you to answer all questions. The following JSON string contains the questions: '{questions_json}'. Each question is characterized by an ID ('question_id'), question type ('question_type'),  and a label ('question_label'). Additionally, if the question type requires it you will also be provided with answer options. You might find more context about the questions in the body text quoted above. In particular, you will find any answer options in the text above. Please strictly adhere to the answer options given above. If the question type is 'number', please only provide an integer number.  This means that for each identified question, you must provide three variables: 'id' gives the question ID, 'answer' contains your response, and 'reason' contains your reasoning for the response. The above implies that each question must be answered with a dict of these three variables and, 'questions' becomes a list of dicts if there is more than one question. Taken together, a correct answer to a text with two questions would have the form {{""summary"": ""Your summary"", ""questions"": [{{""id"": ""ID of first question"", ""answer"": ""Your answer"", ""reason"": ""Your reasoning""}}, {{""id"": ""ID of second question"", ""answer"": ""Your answer"", ""reason"": ""Your reasoning""}}]}} Please provide your answer ONLY as JSON. Please note that, while you can use JSON to structure the summary content, the 'summary' variable itself must be provided as a string.
