    <p>
        This is a short experiment in decision making. 
        In this experiment, you will be matched with another participant. 
        Neither of you will ever know the identity of the other. 
        The money that you earn will be paid to you privately and in cash.
    </p>
    <p>
        Two possible monetary payments are available to you and your 
        counterpart in the experiment. The payments depend on the option 
        chosen by you. We showed the two payment options to your counterpart. 
        The only information you will have is the message your 
        counterpart sends to you.
    </p>
    <p>
        Two possible messages could be sent:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Message 1: “Option A will earn you more money than option B.”
        </li>
        <li>
            Message 2: “Option B will earn you more money than option A.”
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Your counterpart decided to send you Message {{message}}.
    </p>
    <p>
        We now ask you to choose either option A or option B. 
        Your choice will determine the payments in the experiment. 
        You will never know what sums were actually offered in the 
        option not chosen (that is, if the message sent by your 
        counterpart was true or not). Moreover, you will never know 
        the sums your counterpart could be paid with the other option.
        We will pay the two of you according to the choice you make.    
    </p>
    <p>
        We now ask you to choose one of the following two possible 
        messages, which you will send to your counterpart:
    </p>
