    <p>
    This is a short experiment in decision making. 
    In this experiment, you will be matched with another participant. 
    Neither of you will ever know the identity of the other. 
    The money that you earn will be paid to you privately and in cash.
    </p>
    <p>
    Two possible monetary payments are available to you and your 
    counterpart in the experiment. The two payment options are:
    <ul>
        <li>Option A: ${{ C.AMOUNT_A1 }} to you and 
            ${{ C.AMOUNT_A2 }} to the other participant.
        </li>
    </li>
        <li>Option B: ${{ C.AMOUNT_B1 }} to you and 
            ${{ C.AMOUNT_B2 }} to the other participant.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The choice rests with the other participant who will have 
        to choose either option A or option B. The only information 
        your counterpart will have is information sent by you in a 
        message. That is, he or she will not know the monetary payments 
        associated with each choice.
    </p>
    <p>
        We now ask you to choose one of the following two possible messages, 
        which you will send to your counterpart:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Message 1: “Option A will earn you more money than option B.”
        </li>
        <li>
            Message 2: “Option B will earn you more money than option A.”
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        We will show the other participant your message, and ask him or her 
        to choose either A or B. To repeat, your counterpart's choice will 
        determine the payments in the experiment. However, your counterpart 
        will never know what sums were actually offered in the option not 
        chosen (that is, he or she will never know whether your message was 
        true or not). Moreover, he or she will never know the sums to be 
        paid to you according to the different options.
    </p>
    <p>
        We will pay the two of you according to the choice made by your 
        counterpart.
