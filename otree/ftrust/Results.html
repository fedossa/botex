            This round, your investor has decided to invest 
            {{ group.sent_amount }} into the firm.
            As the firm is very profitable, this investment has lead to
            a firm return of {{ tripled_amount }}.
            You chose to pay a dividend of {{ group.sent_back_amount }},
            to the investor. Thus your private compensation of this round is
